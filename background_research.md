# Background Research

This document can be used to collate resources that will inform tool creation. 

As a starting point, the following papers provide some discussion of why it's important to pay attention to the carbon foopring of MRI scanning and neuroscience research:

* [Woolen et al. (2025)][1] - Green imaging: Scoping review of radiology’s environmental impact
* [Jackson (2023)][2] - Sustainable imaging in the era of the climate emergency: a personal view
* [McKee et al. (2024)][3] - Planetary health and radiology: Why we should care and what we can do
* [Rae et al. (2022)][4] - Climate crisis and ecological emergency: Why they concern (neuro)scientists, and what we can do
* [Aron et al. (2020)][5] - How can neuroscientists respond to the climate emergency?
* [Souter et al. (2023)][6] - Ten recommendations for reducing the carbon footprint of research computing in human neuroimaging

On a practical note, the following papers can be used to estimate the energy usage of MRI scanning:

* [Woolen et al. (2023)][7] - Ecodesign and operational strategies to reduce the carbon footprint of MRI for energy cost savings
* [Chodorowski et al. (2024)][8] - Energy consumption in MRI: Determinants and management options
* [Alerte et al. (2025)][9] - Towards sustainable magnetic resonance neuro imaging: Pathways for energy optimization and cost reduction strategies
* [McAlister et al. (2022)][10] - The carbon footprint of hospital diagnostic imaging in Australia

And these papers can be used to estimate the energy usage of fMRI data processing and storage:

* [Souter et al. (2024)][11] - Measuring and reducing the carbon footprint of fMRI preprocessing in fMRIPrep
* [Souter et al. (2025)][12] - Comparing the carbon footprint of fMRI data processing and analysis approaches
